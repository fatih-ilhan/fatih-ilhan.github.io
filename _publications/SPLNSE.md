## Abstract
<div style="text-align: justify">In this paper, we study the online shortest path learning problem under semi-bandit 
feedback in adversarial environments. To this end, we use the online convex optimization framework. We introduce an 
optimal online shortest path algorithm that guarantees to learn the shortest path in an sequential manner. Since we do 
not have any statistical assumptions on the path delays, the results in the paper are guaranteed to hold in an 
individual sequence manner. Hence, our algorithm can be used for a wide range of network optimization problems that 
require exploration and exploitation at the same time.</div>
