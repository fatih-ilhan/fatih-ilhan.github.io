##Abstract

In this paper, we propose a new deep learning
based model that uses convolutional neural networks for spatiotemporal
crime prediction. To learn the temporal pattern of
crime events, we employ a temporally hierarchical structure that
branches along the temporal dimension. In addition, channel
projection is applied to capture the separate influences of crime
events over future crime risk. In the results section, our model is
compared with classical methods and the performance is analyzed
on publicly available Chicago and Los Angeles crime datasets.
The proposed model significantly improves the performance
compared to the traditional methods.
