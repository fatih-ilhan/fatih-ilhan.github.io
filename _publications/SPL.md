## Abstract
<div style="text-align: justify">In this paper, we study the online shortest path learning problem under semi-bandit 
feedback in adversarial and non-stationary environments. To develop an efficient algorithm, we use the online convex 
optimization framework. We introduce an optimal online shortest path algorithm that guarantees to obtain the 
performance of the shortest path sequence. Since we do not have any statistical assumptions on the path delays, the 
results in the paper are guaranteed to hold in an individual sequence manner. Hence, our algorithm can be used for a 
wide range of practical network optimization problems that require exploration and exploitation at the same time.</div>
