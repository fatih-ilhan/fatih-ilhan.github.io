## Abstract
<div style="text-align: justify">In this study, we propose a new two-stage machine
learning based training algorithm that aims increasing multiclass
classification performance through incorporating anomaly
detection. In the first stage, separate anomaly detectors are
trained for each class. Then, a multi-class classifier is trained
using the obtained anomaly scores obtained during the first stage
in addition to the raw features. The performance of the proposed
approach is analyzed over numerous datasets and compared with
traditional methods. The proposed model significantly improves
the performance of traditional multi-class classifiers.</div>
