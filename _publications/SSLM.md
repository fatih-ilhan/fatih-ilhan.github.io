##Abstract

In this study, we analyze the performance of
semi-supervised learning methods under different missing label
patterns and missing label proportions. Some semi-supervised
learning methods make several assumptions about the missingness
mechanism or data characteristics to promote performance
improvement compared to supervised techniques. On the other
hand, some works do not even consider the underlying patterns
of missing labels. To investigate the behavior of these methods or
verify their assumptions, we constructed partially labeled datasets
virtually through simulating different missingness patterns over
fully labeled datasets.We analyze the performance of support vector
machines with self-training (SVM-ST) and Gaussian mixture
models with semi-supervised expectation maximization (GMMSSEM).
We also compare these methods with their supervised
counterparts in terms of performance. Results show that missing
label patterns and proportions have significant effects on
performance.
