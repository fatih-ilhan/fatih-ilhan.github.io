## Abstract
In this study, we work on online learning with long
short term memory (LSTM) based networks is investigated. For
LSTM-based online learning, a computationally efficient training
algorithm based on extended Kalman filter (EKF) is proposed.
We show the considerable performance improvements achieved
by the proposed algorithm through comparing with conventional
LSTM methods in simulations. Results particularly show that the
proposed algorithm achieves very similar performance with conventional
methods in 25-40 times shorter training time depending
on the network complexity.
