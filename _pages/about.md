## Bio

<div style="text-align: justify"><p>I received my B.Sc. and M.Sc. degree with high honors from <b>Bilkent University</b> in June 2019 and August 2021 respectively. I am currently a CS <b>Ph.D. student</b> at the School of Computer Science, <b>Georgia Institute of Technology</b>, under the supervision of  <a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~lingliu/"><b>Prof. Ling Liu</b></a> .</p></div>

<div style="text-align: justify"><p>During the senior year of my B.Sc. studies, I conducted research on unsupervised video anomaly detection and spatio-temporal event modeling with point processes under the supervision of  <a href="http://kilyos.ee.bilkent.edu.tr/~kozat/"><b>Prof. Suleyman S. Kozat</b></a> as an undergraduate researcher. During the same period, I have also worked as a part-time data scientist at <a href="http://data-boss.com.tr/"><b>DataBoss Analytics Inc.</b></a> , where I worked as a <b>machine learning engineer</b> from June 2019 until July 2021. During my M.Sc. studies, I have mainly worked on time series modeling and prediction under adversarial and nonstationary environments. In addition, I have worked on efficient online learning algorithms with convergence guarantees and adaptive switching methods for time series prediction.</p></div>

<div style="text-align: justify"><p>I have achieved the <b>191st rank nationwide</b> in the Turkish National University Entrance Examinations among 2 million students. During my B.Sc. studies, I have been awarded the <b>Comprehensive Scholarship</b> by Bilkent University and <b>JASSO Scholarship</b> for my exchange studies in <b>Nagoya University</b> Japan. During my M.Sc. studies, I have been awarded the <b>Full Scholarship</b> by Bilkent University and <b>TUBITAK Scholarship</b> by The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey.</p></div>

<div style="text-align: justify"><p>I have authored <a href="#journal-papers"><b>4 journal papers</b></a> in highly respected IEEE Transactions and <a href="#conference-papers"><b>6 conference papers</b></a> in refereed high impact conference proceedings. I have also contributed to <a href="http://github.com/fatih-ilhan"><b>9 open-source software projects</b></a> on Github. My research interests include big data systems, distributed/federated learning, time-series prediction, spatio-temporal event modeling and anomaly detection.</p></div>
